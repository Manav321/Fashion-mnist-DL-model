## Overview

This repository contains a deep learning model built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images of fashion items, consisting of 10 different classes, making it a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

In this project, we have implemented a CNN-based model to classify fashion items into their respective categories with high accuracy.


## Model Architecture

Our deep learning model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. You can find the complete model architecture and details in the `fashion_mnist.ipynb` file within this repository.
